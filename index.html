        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Azalea. I am studying at the University of California, Riverside. I plan to graduate in the year 2022. I like playing soccer. I also enjoy dancing folklorico, which I dance at UCR through the club on campus. The clubâ€™s name is Ballet Folklorico de UCR. I am currently in my second year at UCR. I am writing this bio and for my website that I am programming right now. I am programming the website for my computer science class that I am currently enrolled in. I need to meet the word count requirement of about 500 words and am currently at about 100.

Another thing that I like doing besides dancing is playing soccer. I love playing soccer. I also like riding my skateboard and learning how to play the guitar. I also like reading. I used to read books all the time for fun when I was younger. I wish I still had time to read for fun. Most of the things that I read now are assigned to me and I need to read and analyze them for a grade. Most of the books that I get assigned to read in college are very interesting. I used to think about writing a book when I was younger, but I think that I would rather read what others wrote than try to come up with a fiction story on my own.
 <br><br>

        I am enjoying my time at college at the University of California, Riverside. I really enjoy taking classes that I am interested in, such as Spanish and Latin American Studies. The most interesting Spanish class that I have had so far focused on poetry. I had never had a whole class on that before, in English or Spanish. I especially like when the poems are written by younger people, because it is interesting to see what the world is like through their point of view. I enjoy reading poems in Spanish almost as much as I enjoy reading works of literature.<br><br>

        I worked at Taco Bell for the past two years. I recently started a new job on campus for a journal. Working as a cashier and a cook was very fun, I enjoyed meeting new people and having conversations with many different types of people. People are interesting when they are hungry. The menu was on the ceiling and that was the first thing that people would look at as they came into the restaurant. Though working there was fun, it was also very hard. It hurts to stand all day for eight hours or more and to repeat it day after day and month after month. I am lucky that I donâ€™t have to work all day standing up anymore. Now most of my day at work is spent sitting at a computer answering emails or keeping track of books and such. I enjoy the exercise I get when I skate to each of my classes before or after work every day. It is fun.
